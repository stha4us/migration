###  <img src = "sample/home.png" width="55" height="40" /> [MIGRATION PROJECT HOME](https://github.com/npdatax/migration)

This is a project based on simulated data of people returning to Nepal from diffirent countries. Based on their data of gender, area of involvement, skills and experience etc. We will create a dashboard for the general data view. This dish board will utilize a data integration through MongoDB.

| Random migration data will be generated by data generator class written in python, in real data collection scenario and web app will be used to collect the data from users | Simulated data in the MongoDB database will be used in web app made for visualization, pymongo will be used to play around with data | Chart.js and D3.js are data visualization tools in web apps along with Node.js and Express.js | Once internal working API are created, front line view will be design with HTML,CSS and java script |
